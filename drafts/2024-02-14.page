These are the initiatives I believe need to be undertaken to strongly promote Common Lisp:

1. Start a yearly Common Lisp developers conference (details to follow)
2. Make a grants program to both encourage the development of specific projects and to allow for requests for grants
3. Improve the [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/)
4. Finish the *complete* [Common Lisp Tutorial](https://lisp-docs.github.io/docs/tutorial)
